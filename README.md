## Hey there!

### My name is Ethan Wong, and I am a rising third-year student at Northeastern University studying a dual-degree in Computer Science and Political Science

I've been coding in Python since I was 10, and have proficiencies in R, C, Java, Kotlin, NextJS, React, SQL, and MongoDB outside of that.

- Currently working on personal projects like a personal website, as well as looking for a novel project in data analytics/data management
- Currently studying for Bachelors but also taking Masters-level classes with an interest in AI and Machine Learning

If there's any questions, feel free to reach out at my email, wong.ethan2@northeastern.ed
