## Hey there!

### My name is Ethan Wong, and I am a current third-year student at Northeastern University and a candidate for a dual-degree in Computer Science and Political Science

I've been coding in Python since I was 10, and have proficiencies in R, C, Java, Kotlin, Typescript, NextJS, React, SQL, NoSQL, and MongoDB besides that.

- Currently working on personal projects like a personal website (see the webapp repository or www.ethanwong05.vercel.app, currently looking for a domain), as well as looking for a novel project in data analytics/data management
- Just finished a co-op where I learned applicable skills in research, and got to work with state-of-the-art AI tools
- Currently studying for Bachelors but also taking Masters-level classes with an interest in AI and Machine Learning

Feel free to check out any of my pinned projects below!\
If there's any questions, feel free to reach out at my email, wong.ethan2@northeastern.edu or my linkedin [here!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ewong05)
